# Python Web Scraper for Blog Posts

This is a simple Python script that scrapes blog post titles and dates from specific URLs. The script is configured to work with URLs from Amazon Developer Blogs and Retool Blogs.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python 3 and pip (Python package installer) installed on your system. The script uses the BeautifulSoup4 and requests libraries. You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Usage

To use this script, you need a CSV file with a list of URLs to scrape. The URLs should be in a column named 'URL' (or modify the script to match your column name). Each URL should point to a blog post on the Amazon Developer Blogs or Retool Blogs website.

You can run the script with the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will output the title and date of each blog post to the console.

## Customization

The script can be customized to work with other websites or to extract different information. You would need to modify the BeautifulSoup selectors to match the HTML structure of the target website.
